<p>As a developer many times i need to expose my localhost application to the web for demo
                        purposes or to
                        test my web application api with a webhook which only post to a live url. Either you should
                        have a
                        hosting for it or if you don't have much money spent on hosting you can still make you
                        localhost
                        applicaiton live with an application <a href="https://ngrok.com" target="_blank">ngrok</a>
</p>
<p><a href="https://ngrok.com" target="_blank">Ngrok</a> is a multiplatform tunnelling, reverse
                        proxy
                        software that establishes secure tunnels from a public endpoint such as internet to a
                        locally running
                        network service while capturing all traffic for detailed inspection and replay.</p>
<p>In my case i am gonna show you how you can make your visual studio web application live with
                        ngrok</p>
<p>First of all you need your application run in the localhost. I believe that you already have
                        your
                        application which is running the localhost. I am just showing you a basic application which
                        is running
                        on my localhost:3000 and supports a post request from user and we will make that live with
                        <a href="https://ngrok.com" target="_blank">ngrok</a> so that we can post the data to live
                        url
                        generated with ngrok and get response from it.
                    </p>
<p>So my localhost applicaiton is running</p>
<p><img src="../assets/img/blogs/0001_1.png"/></p>
<p>We need ngrok to be download first, so we will go to <a href="https://ngrok.com/download" target="_blank">https://ngrok.com/download</a> and download the latest version of the
                        ngrok
                        application.</p>
<p>once you downloaded the ngrok exe simple run it by double click on it. its a portable command
                        running
                        application which will launch immediately and you will see the command prompt like below</p>
<p><img src="../assets/img/blogs/0001_2.png"/></p>
<p>Now there will be simple command to make you localhost application live to web. which will
                        like this</p>
<span class="code">ngrok http 3000</span>
<p>Note: 3000 here is my port number. In your case it could be different. </p>
<p>It is possible if you are using the ngrok for the first time it could prompt you for
                        authrozie to use
                        ngrok with api key. In that case you should create a new apikey by login into the ngrok and
                        when you
                        reach to your admin dashboard then redirect to Authentication -&gt; Your Auth Token, in the
                        right area you
                        should see your authtoken in the textbox copy it and do the following command</p>
<p><img src="../assets/img/blogs/0001_3.png"/></p><span class="code">ngrok authtoken YOUR AUTH
                        TOKEN</span>
<p>and then again use the</p><span class="code">ngrok http 3000</span>
<p>Sometimes port are very different and big like in 5 digits (44533, 55677, 34343 etc). It
                        might give you
                        trouble. so for that you can use the following command to make your application live</p>
<span class="code">ngrok http 3000 -host-header="localhost:3000"</span>
<p>If the above query runs successfully you will see the terminal like below. You can copy any
                        of the
                        highlited link and visit into the web, it will treat as same as trated in localhost </p>
