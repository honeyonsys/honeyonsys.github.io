                        <p>As a developer many times i need to expose my localhost application to the web for demo
                            purposes or to test my web application api with a webhook which only post
                            to a live url. Either you should have a hosting for it or if you don't have much money spent
                            on hosting you can still make you localhost applicaiton live with an application <a
                                href="https://ngrok.com" target="_blank">ngrok</a></p>
                        <p><a href="https://ngrok.com" target="_blank">Ngrok</a> is a multiplatform tunnelling, reverse
                            proxy software that establishes secure tunnels from a public endpoint such as internet to a
                            locally running network service while capturing all traffic for detailed inspection and
                            replay.</p>
                        <p>In my case i am gonna show you how you can make your visual studio web application live with
                            ngrok</p>
                        <p>First of all you need your application run in the localhost. I believe that you already have
                            your application which is running the localhost. I am just showing you a basic application
                            which is running on my localhost:3000 and supports a post request from user
                            and we will make that live with <a href="https://ngrok.com" target="_blank">ngrok</a> so
                            that we can post the data to live url generated with ngrok and get response from it.</p>
                        <p>So my localhost applicaiton is running</p>
                        <p><img src="assets/img/blogs/0001_1.png"></p>
                        <p>We need ngrok to be download first, so we will go to <a href="https://ngrok.com/download"
                                target="_blank">https://ngrok.com/download</a> and download the latest version of the
                            ngrok application.</p>
                        <p>once you downloaded the ngrok exe simple run it by double click on it. its a portable command
                            running application which will launch immediately and you will see the command prompt like
                            below</p>
                        <p><img src="assets/img/blogs/0001_2.png" /></p>
                        <p>Now there will be simple command to make you localhost application live to web. which will
                            like this</p>
                        <span class="code">ngrok http 3000</span>
                        <p>Note: 3000 here is my port number. In your case it could be different. </p>
                        <p>It is possible if you are using the ngrok for the first time it could prompt you for
                            authrozie to use ngrok with api key. In that case you should create a new apikey by login
                            into the ngrok and when you reach to your admin dashboard then redirect to Authentication ->
                            Your Auth Token, in the right area you should see your authtoken in the textbox copy it and
                            do the following command</p>
                        <p><img src="assets/img/blogs/0001_3.png" /></p>
                        <span class="code">ngrok authtoken YOUR AUTH TOKEN</span>
                        <p>and then again use the</p>
                        <span class="code">ngrok http 3000</span>
                        <p>Sometimes port are very different and big like in 5 digits (44533, 55677, 34343 etc). It
                            might give you trouble. so for that you can use the following command to make your
                            application live</p>
                        <span class="code">ngrok http 3000 -host-header="localhost:3000"</span>
                        <p>If the above query runs successfully you will see the terminal like below. You can copy any
                            of the highlited link and visit into the web, it will treat as same as trated in localhost
                        </p>
